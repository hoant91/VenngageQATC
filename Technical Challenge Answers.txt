Technical Challenge
5.	If you were asked to implement all the tests of sign up page, list out the tests:
You would implement:
 -	Registration successfully
 -	Leave all field empty and click Sign Up button
 -	Validate error message for invalid Name field (shorter than 2 characters, longer than 40 characters).
 -	Validate error message for invalid email field
 -	Validate error message for invalid password field(if password complex is required)
You would not implement and the reasons
6.	If the Google Recaptcha exists, what will you do to unblock the sign up automation tests and further tests after successful registration.
 -	Google Recaptcha is used against automation. So I think we can Disable Captcha for the test build that is used for automation
7.	If you had to run the Sign Up test flow 100 times, each using a different email, what would you do to run the test efficiently?
 -	I will combine the email with a random number (E.g. test1357@venngage.com)
8.	What else would you verify to make sure that the account has signed up successfully?
 -	Should verify that account is stored in the database.
 -	If can't access to db => should sign in by that account to verify the account has signed up successfully.
